        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated bird, with attributes of wild species
        such as the red and grey junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
        is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
        castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).<sup>[2][3]</sup>
        Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
        'hen'.[11][12]
    </p>

    <h2>Etimology</h2>
    <p> According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century
        as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[23][24][25]
        and is widely used throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night</p>
